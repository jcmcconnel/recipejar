# Code name: shiny-fortnight
This is a re-write of an old Recipe Organizer I had written in java.  The code of the last working copy was lost, but the last working builds can be found here: [https://github.com/yehoodig/recipejar](https://github.com/yehoodig/recipejar)


Shiny-fortnight was a repository name suggestion from GitHub, and it seemed like a great code name.

# A work in progress...
If you are interested in some of my personal family recipes, you can find that data in the Test directory.  The application itself compiles and runs.  Most components have been rebuilt, but there are a lot of functionality that has not been reimplemented yet.  

You can use it to view the recipes just fine, but editing and creating new isn't ready yet.
