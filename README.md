# To Do

   Figure out how to manage relationships.  I am ready to start building the menu and adding actions.
      - Thinking about building a hashmap with actions created by different parts of the program that any menu in the program can populate itself from.
      - In Java this has to be done, by using a hashmap of <String, [Interface]>, where the interface type is effectively a way to implement lambda, or anonymous functions.
      - I don't want to have to build a new class for every action in the program.
